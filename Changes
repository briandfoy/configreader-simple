	* If your teammates are using config directives with characters
	outside of \w, they're going to make you upgrade. :)

1.15 - 2002-10-22
	* new_multiple can keep going if it cannot read a file
	* added $Die, $Warn, $ERROR, %Error variables for settings
	* things that should croak do

	* added new_multiple() to parse multiple files into the same
	object.

0.91 - 1997-11-03
	* you don't need to call parse() since new() does it for you
	* you can use the NAME=VALUE format in config files thanks to
		Alan W. Jurgensen <jurgensen@berbee.com>
	* the module is now maintained by brian d foy, briandfoy@pobox.com

0.9 - 2000-08-11
   * Bumped up the version number because it's nearly mature
   * Now you can declare all, some or no keys and it will only die if a
     declared key is not found in the config file.
     (Kim Ryan <kimaryan@ozemail.com.au>)

0.5 - 1999-02-10
   * Changed module name to ConfigReader::Simple to match up with
     other modules in CPAN better.
   * Quote delimiters now have to be matched, ie not 'foo" etc.
   * Doesn't get confused by trailing whitespace
   * Copes with quote-delimited strings as long as they're all on the
   same line.
