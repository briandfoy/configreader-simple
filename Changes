1.17 - Sun Nov 30 11:12:50 2003
	+ some fix ups for the POD docs
	+ fixed a problem in t/pod.t so the test finds the files
	+ if you already have this installed, you don't need this update

New in 1.20
	- Removed all module dependencies except Test::More

New in 1.15
	- new_multiple can keep going if it cannot read a file
	- added $Die, $Warn, $ERROR, %Error variables for settings
	- things that should croak do

New in 1.14
	- cleaned up Makefile.PL
	- added prereq test

New in 1.12
	_ added add_config_file() to pull in more configuration directives

New in 1.11
	- added new_multiple() to parse multiple files into the same
	object.
	
New in 0.91
	- you don't need to call parse() since new() does it for you
	- you can use the NAME=VALUE format in config files thanks to
		Alan W. Jurgensen <jurgensen@berbee.com>
	- the module is now maintained by brian d foy <bdfoy@cpan.org>

New in 0.9
   - Bumped up the version number because it's nearly mature
   - Now you can declare all, some or no keys and it will only die if a
     declared key is not found in the config file.

New in 0.5
   - Changed module name to ConfigReader::Simple to match up with
     other modules in CPAN better.

   - Quote-delimiters now have to be matched, ie not 'foo" etc.

New in 0.3
   - Doesn't get confused by trailing whitespace

   - Copes with quote-delimited strings as long as they're all on the
   same line.
